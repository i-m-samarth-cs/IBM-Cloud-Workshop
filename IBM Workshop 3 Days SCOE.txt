IBM Workshop 3 Days SCOE

Day 1

(i)What is Cloud?
Demanding any service with the help of internet is called as cloud.
We can make use of any device to connect with cloud just having the internet connectivity

Types of Cloud

1)Public Cloud - Resources are shared with different companies or different customers
2)Private Cloud - Resources are give to the single client or customer
3)Hybrid Cloud - Resources are used in a mix pole private as well as public 

Cloud service Architecture

1)SaaS - Software as a Serivce
2)PaaS - Platform as a Service
3)IaaS - Infrastructure as a service

Services provided by cloud providers

1)VM - Virtual Machine
2)Networking Services
3)Storage Services
4)Machine Learning Services
5)AI Services

Name of the Cloud Providers

(i)IBM Cloud
(ii)AWS
(iii)GCP - Google Cloud Platform
(iv)Microsoft Azure
(v)Oracle


# CASE STUDY #

So Firstly as we are going to start an IT Industry on cloud with 100 employees so we need to create a private netowork of 100 employees gaining the access of data just to the employees on the cloud with authentication
Also make an facility to make the groups between the employees and make an platoform where the problem can be given to the employees and make a way for the employees to add there solution on the platform provided to them
Also a way to gather meetings of the employees and discuss with the autorites regarding the project 


Day 2 Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Machine Learning 

It is train the machine with the help of data 

Types of Machine Learning

1)Supervised Machine Learning - We will provide the data with the label 
ex image along with data

(i)Classification ML - identifying the categories
(ii)Regression ML - identifying some numeric values

2)Unsupervised Machine Learning - here we will not provide label just will give the data.

3)Reinforcement Learning - it learn from experience
ex Robot making , game developement

# Steps to create ML Model

(i)Identify the problem statement
(ii)Collect the data and Analyze the data
(iii)Split the data
(iv)Use the appropriate ML Algorithm to train the model
(v)Check the performance of the model
(vi)Save and deploy the model


Problem Statement 
-----------------
Design and develope the machine learning model to identify type of the iris flower

(i)Search for Watson Studio 
Is Service by IBM to create machine learning model without coding
(ii)Watson Machine Learning Services
(iii)Storage Service for .csv
(iv)Go to asset search for autoai
(v)Associate ml service
(v)Upload your .csv file
(vi)Save the module
(vii)GO to navigation menu and Delete the resources (services)under AI and ML of the cloud

## Resource Deletion is Important to start a new process
At a time we can work on one project only thus 

.ipynb - interactive python notebook

90% training and 10% testing
Always select free plans

Problem Statement telecom

Design and develope a machine learning model to predicate the customer churn
